## Description

Solar System Simulator is a Python project that provides an interactive 2D simulation of celestial bodies' movements within our solar system. It visualizes the orbits and interactions between planets and other celestial objects using Newtonian gravity.

## Features

- Realistic simulation of planetary movements based on gravitational forces.
- Visualization of orbits, positions, and velocities of planets.
- Interactive controls to adjust simulation parameters, zoom, and view angles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library

## Installation and Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the `matplotlib` library by running `pip install matplotlib` in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the repository directory using the terminal.
5. Run the `solarsystem.py` file using Python: `python solarsystem.py`.

## Controls

- Adjust simulation parameters in the code to modify the time step, number of iterations, etc.
- Use the arrow keys to navigate through the solar system and explore different perspectives.
- Observe the dynamic movements of planets and other celestial bodies.
